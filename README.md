# Fenrus


Fenrus is a magical gateway to the wonderful wizardly world.   

It acts as a magic home page and allows for a quick overview of your favourite apps/sites and lets you organize and quickly navigate this magical world.

## Shortcuts
Shortcuts are broken down into 3 types

### Links
These are basic links to websites, either internal or external, and show no extra information.  You can configure an icon for these links, or if left blank Fenrus will try to magically download the favicon for the site.

### Apps - Basic
These are a step above links, they are known to Fenrus, and will have a high-resolution icon, perhaps a default URL, but little else.

### Apps - Smart
This is where the magic really happens.  These smart apps, or spell casts if you will, have extra information that Fenrus can download and query to display more information about the app.
This could be as simple as some basic information, or it could be a feature-rich magical experience.

## FAQ

Q: What's with all the magic stuff?
A: I named the app Fenrus, Erasmus was taken, from a wizard character from Quest for Glory.  It's hard coming up with a domain, especially for something so generic as a homepage-type app.


Q: Why is the logo a wolf when it's named after a magic rat?
A: I googled Fenrus, found it's a giant wolf in World of Warcraft, I couldn't find a decent magic icon so I went for the Wolf for now.
